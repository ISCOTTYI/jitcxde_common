Before you post an issue, please check the following (if applicable):

* Read the [FAQ](https://jitcde-common.readthedocs.io/#common-mistakes-and-questions).
* State your JiTC\*DE version (`jitcode.__version__` or similar). If itâ€™s lower than 1.0, please put some effort into updating first.
* Provide [a minimal and complete example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve). It makes my life considerably easier and you will likely get a helpful answer earlier. Also, there is a chance that you will solve your problem yourself. In particular consider that I cannot know what control parameters you are using.
